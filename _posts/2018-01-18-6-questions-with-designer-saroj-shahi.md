### 1) How did you get into tech and designing world ?
Iâ€™ve always been amused by technology and design ever since my childhood days. My uncleâ€™s friend, who is a designer himself introduced me to web design as a profession.

Started off by learning basic HTML, CSS from a reputed computer institution. Then, gradually taught myself photoshop and other design tools, along with the design principles. Finally, Landed a job back in 2011 and my career took off.

### 2) Can you describe the importance of Design in todayâ€™s world?
For me, design is not only about pretty pixels. Its more about how you solve a complex usability problem and simplify it in the best possible way.

Design is the first impression the product gives to its users or the audience. And I believe a lot of people today have realized this fact.

### 3) How do you keep yourself updated?
I try to keep up with the latest design trends from design showcase websites like Dribbble, Material Up, Behance etc. I read a lot of article related to design thinking on Designer news, medium and other design blogs.

And I also get inspirations from a lot of designers on twitter, instagram and facebook design groups.

### 4) What is the biggest challenge you face in your day-to-day work?
The biggest challenge for Me and I think any other designer is to keep the creative juice flowing. And try not to be angry at people who donâ€™t like your designs ðŸ˜‚.

### 5) What are your professional goals going forward?
Learning more has always been my topmost goal. And also I want to contribute more to the community and help businesses solve complex design problems.

### 6) What kind of suggestions do you want to give to new students interested to pursue career as a Designer?
First and foremost, ask yourself if you really want to take design as a career. If the answer is â€˜YESâ€™ donâ€™t listen to anyone else and follow [this article](https://uxplanet.org/how-to-start-your-design-career-in-2018-9c56a9203329).
Nobody gets better in a day or two. It will take time, be patient.
